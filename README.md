-----
Parallel Computing | 2022-1 | Universidad Nacional de Colombia


Sobel edge detection filter for an image developed with C and OpenMP (for parallelism)

Upload image files (in format `.png` or `.jpg`) and execute `make run` for build the program

Be careful with images path (all in the root directory)

For execution pls run :

```
  ./filter <"img_in_name"> <"img_out_name"> <number_of_threads>
```

Due to best git/hub practices, imgs are not provided
